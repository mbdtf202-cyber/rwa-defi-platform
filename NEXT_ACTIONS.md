### 2. Integration Testing (Priority: CRITICAL)

**Owner**: QA Team  
**Duration**: 1 week  
**Status**: Test Plan Ready

#### Test Scenarios:

**Day 1-2: Smart Contract Integration**
```bash
# Run integration tests
cd packages/contracts
npm run test:integration -- --network sepolia

# Test scenarios:
- Token minting flow
- SPV creation and property addition
- Vault deposit and withdrawal
- AMM swap operations
- Lending pool borrow/repay
- Oracle price updates
- Document registry
```

**Day 3-4: Backend Integration**
```bash
# Update backend with testnet addresses
cd packages/backend
# Edit .env with Sepolia contract addresses

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Test scenarios:
- User registration and KYC
- SPV management
- Token operations via Fireblocks
- Payment processing
- Document upload to IPFS
- Blockchain event listening
```

**Day 5-6: Frontend Integration**
```bash
# Update frontend with testnet config
cd rwa-defi-platform
# Edit src/config/contracts.json

# Manual testing:
- Wallet connection
- User onboarding flow
- Property browsing and investment
- DeFi operations (vault, AMM, lending)
- Admin panel operations
- Document management
```

**Day 7: Full End-to-End**
```
Complete user journey:
1. User registers → KYC → Wallet connect
2. Admin creates SPV → Adds property → Uploads docs
3. Admin mints tokens → Distributes to investors
4. User invests → Views portfolio → Receives dividends
5. User uses DeFi features (vault, AMM, lending)
6. User redeems tokens → Receives payment
```
